            <p class="center-align">Wildlife photography is a genre of photography concerned with documenting
               various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat.As well as requiring photography skills,
                wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For example, some animals are difficult
                to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's behavior is needed in order to be able to
                predict its actions. Photographing some species may require stalking skills or the use of
                a hide/blind for concealment.

              is a branch of vernacular photography.The main application of professional sports photography
              is for editorial purposes; dedicated sports photographers usually work for newspapers,
              major wire agencies or dedicated sports magazines.
